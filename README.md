# PyB4ML
PyB4ML is a free open-source collection of algorithms in Bayesian machine learning written in Python for Bayesian reasoning and probabilistic programming.

At the moment, the collection contains the following inference algorithms:
- Belief Propagation Algotirthm (BPA) (pb4ml/algorithms/inference/belief_propagation.py)
- Bucket Elimination Algorithm (BEA) (pb4ml/algorithms/inference/bucket_elimination.py)

and the following probabilistic graphical models:
- Bayesian network "Student" (pb4ml/models/factor_graphs/student.py)

See the use of algorithms in the tests.
